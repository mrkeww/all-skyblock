**mc-modpack-kit** is a GitHub Actions workflow template designed to streamline the release process of Minecraft modpacks. It automates tasks like version extraction, building the modpack, and publishing it to platforms like Modrinth and CurseForge.

**Important**: To maintain a clear and organized version history, it is strongly recommended to follow the [Conventional Commit Messages](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format for your commit messages. This format ensures consistency and enables automated versioning and changelog generation.
